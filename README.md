What is Docker ?

A Docker container is a tool that makes it very easy to deploy and run an application using containers. 
A container allows a developer to create an all-in-one package of the developed application with all its dependencies. 
For example, a Java application requires Java libraries, and when we deploy it on any system or VM, we need to install Java first. But, in a container, everything is kept together and shipped as one package, such as in a Docker container.
